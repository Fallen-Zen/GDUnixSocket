 @param maxConnections The maximum simultaneous connections count. If 0 is passed `kGDUnixSocketServerMaxConnectionsDefault` value is used (which is 5). If a connection request arrives when the queue is full, the client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED or, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds.
